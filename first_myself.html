        A website (also written as a web site) is one or more web pages and
        related content that is identified by a common domain name and published
        on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a
        particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
        entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides
        the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. The
        most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook. All
        publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
        There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private
        network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Users
        can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops,
        tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web
        browser.

        The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN
        computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.[1][2] On 30 April 1993, CERN
        announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone,
        contributing to the immense growth of the Web.[3] Before the
        introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols
        such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to
        retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple
        directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose
        files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text
        files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.

        While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web
        site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide
        Web), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the
        standard spelling. All major style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of
        Style[4] and the AP Stylebook,[5] have reflected this change. In
        February 2009, Netcraft, an Internet monitoring company that has tracked
        Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903 websites
        with domain names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732
        websites in August 1995.[6] After reaching 1 billion websites in
        September 2014, a milestone confirmed by Netcraft in its October 2014
        Web Server Survey and that Internet Live Stats was the first to
        announce—as attested by this tweet from the inventor of the World Wide
        Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee—the number of websites in the world have
        subsequently declined, reverting to a level below 1 billion. This is due
        to the monthly fluctuations in the count of inactive websites. The
        number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion by March 2016 and
        has continued growing since.[7] Netcraft Web Server Survey in January
        2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827 websites and in April 2021
        reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 web-facing
        computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains.[8] An estimated 85 percent of
        all websites are inactive.[9]
